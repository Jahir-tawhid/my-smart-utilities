# 🛠️ My Smart Utilities - Logical React Hub

**My Smart Utilities** is a comprehensive React application featuring a collection of essential mathematical and logical tools for everyday use. This project is designed to demonstrate clean code architecture, **Firebase Authentication**, and complex **Business Logic** implementation in a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Key Features & Logic Breakdown

Each tool in this hub is built with specific JavaScript logic to ensure accuracy:

- **Taxi Fare System**: Calculates fares based on distance traveled. It includes logic for a base fare, per-kilometer rates, and an integrated **15% VAT** calculation.
    
- **Electricity Bill**: A slab-based bill generator. It uses `if-else` logic to calculate costs based on different unit consumption tiers (e.g., first 50 units at one rate, next 100 at another).
    
- **Daily Budget**: A finance tracker that monitors Income vs. Expenses. It uses React State to calculate and display the **Real-time Balance**.
    
- **Standard Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) using functional programming.
    
- **Unit Converter**: Mathematical conversion logic for Distance (**KM to Miles**: 1km≈0.621mile) and Length (**Inches to CM**: 1inch=2.54cm).
    
- **Student Grade**: A grading logic system that converts numerical marks into letter grades (e.g., 80+ for A+, 40- for Fail).
    
- **Custom VAT Calculator**: A dynamic tool allowing users to input any price and a custom VAT percentage to see the total cost instantly.
